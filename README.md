### Notes:  
- You will need an **OpenAI API key**, which you can get for free using [OpenAI Genie](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/D0807G0NEEQ).  
- Sometimes, the tool fails to generate ideas in a consistent form. This happens because AI can generate ideas in inconsistent forms sometimes. If this happens, simply try again, and it should work.
